GAME LOGIC
Randomly choose who goes first before game loop 
Display Current Card on top of discard pile 
Display Current Players Hand 
Display Playable cards
If none present or player wants to draw --> 0
    if 0:
    player draws card
    added to hand 
    if 1:

    i think if each card had an assigned number within the players hand it would work better
    this way the player could just pick waht number card within the hand they wanted to play
